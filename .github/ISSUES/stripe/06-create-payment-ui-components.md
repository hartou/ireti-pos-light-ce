Acceptance Criteria:

- [x] Client-side validation and clear error messages
- [x] CSRF protection and secure AJAX calls for payment intent/confirm
- [x] Responsive and accessible UI (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- [x] PWA: graceful offline handling with user messaging; queue attempt and retry strategy documented
- [x] UI tests for form validation and success/failure flows
