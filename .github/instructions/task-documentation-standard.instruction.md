# Task Documentation Standard

## Documentation Requirement for All Tasks

For every task completion, I must create a comprehensive markdown report following this template structure:

### Report File Naming Convention
- File location: `docs/TASK_[NUMBER]_[DESCRIPTION]_REPORT.md`
- Example: `docs/TASK_7_STRIPE_INTEGRATION_REPORT.md`

### Required Report Sections

#### 1. Executive Summary
- Task completion status
- Key objectives achieved
- High-level impact summary

#### 2. Technical Implementation
- Detailed code changes with file paths
- Database schema updates
- New features and functionality
- Architecture decisions

#### 3. Testing Results
- Unit test coverage and results
- Integration testing outcomes
- Browser/E2E testing validation
- Performance metrics

#### 4. Security & Production Readiness
- Security measures implemented
- Production deployment checklist
- Error handling and monitoring
- Compliance considerations

#### 5. Documentation & Knowledge Transfer
- Code documentation updates
- User guides created
- Training materials
- Troubleshooting guides

#### 6. Future Considerations
- Enhancement opportunities
- Scalability improvements
- Technical debt notes
- Next phase planning

### Documentation Standards
- Use clear, professional markdown formatting
- Include code snippets and examples where relevant
- Provide specific file paths and line numbers
- Document both successes and challenges encountered
- Include metrics and measurable outcomes
- Add troubleshooting sections for common issues

### Post-Task Requirements
1. Create comprehensive markdown report in docs folder
2. Update project README if needed
3. Add report to git repository
4. Reference report in commit messages
5. Create summary for stakeholder communication

This documentation practice ensures knowledge preservation, easier maintenance, and clear communication of implementation details for future reference.

## Implementation Notes
- Reports should be written immediately upon task completion
- Include both technical and business perspectives
- Use consistent formatting and structure
- Maintain professional tone suitable for stakeholders
- Focus on actionable information and clear outcomes

This standard will be applied to all future task implementations to maintain comprehensive project documentation.
