# üöÄ Release Process Documentation

## Overview
This document outlines the standardized release process for Ireti POS Light to ensure consistency and proper versioning.

## ü§ñ AI Assistant Instructions

**CRITICAL**: If you are an AI assistant helping with releases, you MUST:

1. **Always use the release helper first**: `./scripts/release.sh help`
2. **Never create releases manually** without checking if the helper script works
3. **Follow the exact process** documented in `.github/instructions/release-management.instruction.md`
4. **Validate all prerequisites** before starting any release process
5. **Create GitHub releases** properly, not just Git tags

### Quick AI Assistant Commands
```bash
# Check if release helper exists and works
./scripts/release.sh help

# Create release using helper (preferred method)
./scripts/release.sh create v[VERSION]

# Only use manual process if helper fails
# (Follow manual steps below)
```
