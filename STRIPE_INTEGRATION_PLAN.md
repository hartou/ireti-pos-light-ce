## 🔒 Security Implementation

### PCI DSS Compliance Checklist
- [ ] Never store card data (use Stripe tokens only)
- [ ] Implement secure data transmission (HTTPS only)
- [ ] Use Stripe Elements for secure card input
- [ ] Validate webhook signatures
- [ ] Implement proper access controls
- [ ] Regular security updates and patches
- [ ] Secure logging (no sensitive data in logs)

### Security Best Practices
```python
# Example secure payment processing
@require_https
@login_required
@permission_required('payments.process_payment')
def process_payment(request):
    try:
        # Validate input
        amount = validate_amount(request.data.get('amount'))
        
        # Create payment intent (no card data stored)
        payment_intent = stripe.PaymentIntent.create(
            amount=int(amount * 100),  # Convert to cents
            currency='usd',
            metadata={'transaction_id': transaction_id}
        )
        
        # Log payment attempt (no sensitive data)
        logger.info(f"Payment intent created: {payment_intent.id}")
        
        return JsonResponse({
            'client_secret': payment_intent.client_secret
        })
    except Exception as e:
        logger.error(f"Payment processing error: {str(e)}")
        return JsonResponse({'error': 'Payment processing failed'}, status=500)
```
