# POS System Test Report - Playwright Automated Testing
**Date:** September 2, 2025  
**Testing Method:** Playwright MCP Visual Testing  
**Environment:** Containerized Docker Application (localhost:8000)  

## Executive Summary

Comprehensive visual testing using Playwright MCP revealed critical integration issues between the register dashboard and payment processing system. While both systems function individually, they are completely disconnected, preventing the completion of end-to-end payment transactions.

## Test Results Overview

✅ **Working Components:**
- User authentication system
- Product management (admin panel)
- Product catalog with demo data
- Register dashboard interface
- Transaction calculation engine
- Stripe payment form interface
- Transaction storage and receipts

❌ **Critical Issues Identified:**
- Register system not connected to Stripe payment processing
- Payment buttons don't trigger Stripe checkout
- Stripe Elements not loading properly in payment form
- No integration between cart contents and payment system

## Detailed Test Scenarios & Results

### 1. Application Startup & Authentication
**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Screenshot:** `01_initial_login_page.png`

- Docker containers started successfully
- Login page loads correctly
- Authentication works with admin credentials
- Successfully logged in and redirected to register dashboard

### 2. Register Dashboard Functionality
**Status:** ⚠️ PARTIAL PASS  
**Screenshots:** `02_register_dashboard.png`, `10_register_with_product_added_buttons_enabled.png`

**Working:**
- Register interface loads correctly
- Barcode scanning functionality works
- Product lookup and validation
- Transaction totals calculate properly (Subtotal: $5.99, Tax: $0.53, Total: $6.52)
- Transaction buttons enable when items are added

**Issues:**
- All payment buttons initially disabled when no items in cart
- Payment buttons lead to mock payment processing, not Stripe

### 3. Product Management & Inventory
**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Screenshots:** `03_price_lookup_page.png`, `04_add_inventory_page.png`, `07_django_admin_panel.png`, `08_add_product_form.png`, `09_products_list_with_demo_data.png`

**Working:**
- Django admin panel accessible and functional
- Product creation form works correctly
- Demo products pre-loaded in database
- Inventory management system operational
- Products can be added, edited, and viewed

**Test Product Created:**
- Barcode: 123456
- Name: Coffee Bean Premium
- Price: $5.99
- Department: Grocery
- Tax: Taxable

### 4. Product Not Found Handling
**Status:** ✅ PASS  
**Screenshots:** `05_product_not_found_error.png`, `06_barcode_not_found_inventory.png`

**Working:**
- Proper error handling for non-existent barcodes
- Clear error messages displayed to user
- Guidance provided to add missing products

### 5. Payment System Integration
**Status:** ❌ CRITICAL FAILURE  
**Screenshots:** `11_transaction_completed_but_no_stripe_processing.png`, `12_stripe_payment_form_disconnected_from_register.png`, `13_stripe_form_reset_missing_card_elements.png`, `14_payment_dashboard_showing_zero_payments.png`

**Critical Issues Identified:**

#### Issue #1: Register Payment Buttons Don't Use Stripe
When clicking "Debit/Credit" from register:
- Redirects to `/endTransaction/` endpoint
- Shows mock transaction completion
- Message: "This is a online register and is not connected to a Cash-Drawer or a Card-Machine"
- Transaction saved in local system but NO payment processing

#### Issue #2: Stripe Payment Form Isolated
The separate Stripe payment form at `/payments/`:
- Has proper interface for amount entry
- Contains customer information fields
- Shows Stripe Elements placeholder for "Card Details"
- But Stripe Elements not loading properly
- Form resets when "Process Payment" clicked
- No connection to register cart data

#### Issue #3: Payment Dashboard Shows Zero Activity
Payment dashboard shows:
- Today's Payments: 0
- Successful Payments: 0
- Pending Payments: 0
- No payments found in transaction table

## Key Integration Gaps

1. **Missing Cart-to-Payment Bridge:** No mechanism to pass cart contents and totals from register to payment form
2. **Stripe Elements Not Loading:** Card input fields not rendering properly
3. **Payment Method Routing:** Register payment buttons bypass Stripe entirely
4. **Transaction Correlation:** No link between register transactions and payment records

## Test Environment Details

**Container Configuration:**
- Python 3.8 Django application
- PostgreSQL database
- Stripe keys configured in environment
- Demo data loaded successfully

**Database State:**
- 6 demo products available
- User authentication working
- Transaction records being stored

## Recommendations

### Priority 1: Connect Register to Stripe
- Modify register payment buttons to redirect to Stripe payment form
- Pass cart contents and totals as parameters
- Implement session-based cart preservation

### Priority 2: Fix Stripe Elements Loading
- Debug Stripe publishable key configuration
- Ensure Stripe.js and Elements are properly initialized
- Add error handling for Stripe configuration issues

### Priority 3: Implement Transaction Correlation
- Link register transactions with Stripe payment intents
- Update transaction status based on payment results
- Implement proper success/failure flows

### Priority 4: End-to-End Testing
- Create automated tests for complete payment flow
- Test with actual Stripe test cards
- Validate webhook processing
