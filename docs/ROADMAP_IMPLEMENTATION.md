## 🚀 Next Steps for Repository Owner

### Immediate Actions Required

1. **Enable GitHub Pages**
   ```bash
   # Go to repository settings and enable GitHub Pages
   # Source: main branch, /docs folder
   # URL: https://hartou.github.io/ireti-pos-light-ce/
   ```

2. **Create Roadmap Issues**
   ```bash
   # Authenticate GitHub CLI
   gh auth login
   
   # Create all roadmap issues
   bash scripts/create_roadmap_issues.sh hartou/ireti-pos-light-ce
   ```

3. **Set Up Project Board** (Optional)
   ```bash
   # Create project board for roadmap tracking
   gh project create --title "Ireti POS CE Roadmap" --body "Development roadmap tracking"
   ```

### Configuration Steps

1. **GitHub Pages Setup**
   - Navigate to: https://github.com/hartou/ireti-pos-light-ce/settings/pages
   - Set source to "Deploy from a branch"
   - Select branch: `main`, folder: `/docs`
   - Optionally configure custom domain

2. **Issue Labels Setup** (Automatic)
   The `create_roadmap_issues.sh` script will automatically create these labels:
   - `roadmap` - All roadmap-related issues
   - `priority:critical`, `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`
   - `type:feature`, `type:documentation`, `area:testing`, etc.

3. **Milestone Creation** (Optional)
   ```bash
   # Create milestones for each phase
   gh milestone create "Phase 2: Stability" --description "Production readiness and stability improvements"
   gh milestone create "Phase 3: Enhanced Features" --description "Advanced features and user experience"
   ```
