# GitHub Code Scanning Deployment

## Overview

This document describes the GitHub Code Scanning implementation for the ireti-pos-light-ce repository. GitHub Code Scanning has been successfully deployed with comprehensive security analysis workflows.

## 🛡️ Security Scanning Components

### 1. CodeQL Analysis (`.github/workflows/codeql-analysis.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Advanced semantic code analysis for security vulnerabilities
- **Languages**: Python, JavaScript
- **Schedule**: Runs on push to main/develop, PRs, and weekly
- **Features**:
  - Security-extended query pack
  - Quality analysis
  - SARIF results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

### 2. Security Audit (`.github/workflows/security-audit.yml`) 
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive security scanning using multiple tools
- **Tools Integrated**:
  - **Safety**: Python dependency vulnerability scanning
  - **Bandit**: Python code security analysis
  - **Semgrep**: Advanced static analysis
  - **PCI Compliance Check**: Custom PCI DSS verification
- **Schedule**: Daily at 3 AM UTC
- **Outputs**: Security reports uploaded as artifacts

### 3. Dependency Vulnerability Scanning (`.github/workflows/dependency-scan.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Monitor Python dependencies for known vulnerabilities
- **Tools**:
  - **pip-audit**: GitHub Security Advisory Database integration
  - **Safety**: Secondary verification
- **Schedule**: Daily at 1 AM UTC, triggered by dependency changes
- **Features**: SARIF results uploaded to GitHub Security tab

### 4. Secret Scanning (`.github/workflows/secret-scanning.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Detect accidentally committed secrets and credentials
- **Tools**:
  - **detect-secrets**: Baseline secret detection
  - **GitLeaks**: Advanced credential scanning
  - **Custom patterns**: Stripe keys, database URLs, AWS credentials
- **Schedule**: Weekly on Sundays
- **Features**: Full git history scanning, SARIF results

### 5. Dependabot Configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
- **Purpose**: Automated dependency updates for security patches
- **Package Ecosystems**: pip, npm, GitHub Actions
- **Schedule**: Weekly updates on Mondays
- **Features**: Grouped security updates, automatic PR creation

## 🔍 Security Monitoring Dashboard

All security scanning results are accessible through:

1. **GitHub Security Tab** → Code scanning alerts
2. **GitHub Security Tab** → Dependabot alerts  
3. **GitHub Security Tab** → Secret scanning alerts
4. **Actions Tab** → Workflow artifacts for detailed reports

## 🎯 Integration with Existing Security Framework

The GitHub Code Scanning implementation integrates seamlessly with the existing PCI compliance framework:

- **PCI Compliance Script**: Automated execution in security workflows
- **Existing Security Tools**: Safety, Bandit, Semgrep integrated
- **Compliance Verification**: Regular automated PCI DSS checks
- **Documentation**: Maintains existing security documentation standards

## 📊 Workflow Triggers

| Workflow | Push | PR | Schedule | Manual |
|----------|------|----|---------|\-------|
| CodeQL Analysis | ✅ main/develop | ✅ to main | Weekly | ❌ |
| Security Audit | ✅ main/develop | ✅ to main | Daily | ✅ |
| Dependency Scan | ✅ + deps changed | ✅ deps | Daily | ✅ |
| Secret Scanning | ✅ main/develop | ✅ to main | Weekly | ✅ |

## 🚀 Getting Started

### For Developers
1. Code scanning runs automatically on every push and PR
2. Check the Security tab for any alerts
3. Review PR comments for security findings
4. Fix any high/critical issues before merging

### For Administrators  
1. Monitor the Security tab for ongoing alerts
2. Review Dependabot PRs for security updates
3. Investigate secret scanning alerts immediately
4. Use manual workflow triggers for ad-hoc scans

## 📋 Maintenance

### Weekly Tasks
- Review Dependabot security updates
- Check secret scanning results
- Monitor CodeQL analysis trends

### Monthly Tasks
- Review security workflow performance
- Update security scanning configurations
- Audit PCI compliance verification results

### Quarterly Tasks
- Review and update security documentation
- Assess new security scanning tools
- Conduct security posture review
